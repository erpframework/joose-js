To build a release version of Joose, execute this command

perl release.pl -v "VERSION_STRING" -d PATH_TO_RELEASE_DIR

The script will create a directory called joose-VERSION_STRING inside
the directory PATH_TO_RELEASE_DIR. If the directory is already present 
it will be wiped and overriden with the new release.
