<p>Joose.Manual.Singleton - Singleton pattern, "out of the box"</p>

<h1 id="whatisasingleton">WHAT IS A SINGLETON?</h1>

<p>Singleton is a class, which has only a single instance. It often manage some system-wide state or set of helper functions.</p>

<h1 id="syntax">SYNTAX</h1>

<p>To declare a singleton use <code>my</code> builder:</p>

<pre><code>    Class('TypeRegistry', {

        my : {
            has : {
                types : Joose.Object
            },

            does : [ JooseX.Storable ],

            methods : {
                registerType : function (type, value) {
                    ....
                }
            }
        }
    })
</code></pre>

<p>You may use any usual builders inside of <code>my</code>, including method modifires, <code>isa</code>, <code>does</code>, etc. Instance of singleton class will be created right after class declaration.
To access it, use <code>my</code> property of class's constructor, like</p>

<pre><code>    TypeRegistry.my.registerType('textfield', Ext.form.TextField) 
</code></pre>

<p>In Joose, singletons are "attached" to usual classes. This means you can define a usual class with the same name just fine: </p>

<pre><code>    Class('TypeRegistry', {

        has : {
            someAttribute : { is : 'rw' }
        },

        ....

        my : {
            has : {
                types : Joose.Object
            },

            ....
        }
    })
</code></pre>

<p>However, this may easily lead to ambiguity, so you should clearly understand what are you doing. </p>

<h1 id="singletoninheritance">SINGLETON INHERITANCE</h1>

<p>Singletons may inherit from other classes in various ways</p>

<h2 id="directinheritance">Direct inheritance</h2>

<p>You may use <code>isa</code> builder to directly specify from which class your singleton should inherit:</p>

<pre><code>    Class('TypeRegistry', {

        my : {
            isa : Registry,

            ....
        }
    })
</code></pre>

<p>Direct inheritance has a highest priority.</p>

<h2 id="indirectinheritanceviausualclass">Indirect inheritance via usual class</h2>

<p>Joose's singletons are also inheritable as some kind of special "attributes". This mean, that subclasses of class with attached singleton will also have a subclass of that singleton attached :) For example:</p>

<pre><code>    Class('Registry', {

        my : {
            ....
        }
    })

    Class('TypeRegistry', {
        isa : Registry
    })
</code></pre>

<p><code>TypeRegistry</code> will inherit all the attributes of <code>Registry</code>, including a singleton, which will be accessible as <code>TypeRegistry.my</code>. Note however, that a new instance of singleton class will be instantiated.   </p>

<p>You may also specify any additional builders, which will customize the singleton's subclass: </p>

<pre><code>    Class('TypeRegistry', {
        isa : Registry,

        my : {
            override : {
                registerType : function (type, value) {
                    ....
                }
            }
        }
    })
</code></pre>

<p>Indirect inheritance can be also written in "direct" form, which requires some basic knowledge of Joose internals:</p>

<pre><code>    Class('TypeRegistry', {
        my : {
            isa : Registry.my.meta.c
        }
    })
</code></pre>

<h1 id="roleswithsingletons">ROLES WITH SINGLETONS</h1>

<p>In addition to all this singletons wizardry you may create a special, "singleton" roles:</p>

<pre><code>    Role('TypeRegistry.Storable', {

        my : {
            has : {
                storageId : { is : 'rw' }
            },

            override : {
                registerType : function (type, value) {
                    ....
                }
            }
        }
    })
</code></pre>

<p>Such roles should be applied in "indirect form", to the usual class, which will contains the singleton being modified.</p>

<pre><code>    Class('TypeRegistry', {

        does : TypeRegistry.Storable
    })
</code></pre>

<p>The "direct" form of this example:</p>

<pre><code>    Class('TypeRegistry', {

        my : {
            does : TypeRegistry.Storable.my.meta.c,

            ....
        }
    })
</code></pre>
