<p>Joose.Manual.Construction - Object construction with Joose</p>

<h1 id="wherestheconstructor">WHERE'S THE CONSTRUCTOR?</h1>

<p>You do not need to define a constructor method for your classes. Really. Instead, define an <code>initialize</code> method. </p>

<p>When you build a class using Joose it will be managed by the instance of Joose.Meta.Class. This instance (a <em>metaclass instance</em>) provides a constructor for you. 
This constructor will perform attributes initialization and then will call a <code>initialize</code> method with the same arguments.</p>

<p>However, if you are still sure you need a custom constructor you may provide it using a <code>constructor</code> builder:</p>

<pre><code>    Class('User', {

        constructor : function (i, really, know, what, iam, doing) {
        }

        ....
    })
</code></pre>

<h1 id="objectconstructionandattributes">OBJECT CONSTRUCTION AND ATTRIBUTES</h1>

<p>The Joose-provided constructor accepts an object with properties, matching your attributes. This is just another way in which Joose keeps you from worrying how classes are implemented. 
Simply define a class and you're ready to start creating objects!</p>

<pre><code>    Class('User', {
        isa : Person,

        has : {
            password : { init : '12345' },
            lastLogin : { init : function () { return new Date() } }
        }
    })

    var user = new User({
        password : 'abcdef',
        lastLogin : 'Yesterday'
    })
</code></pre>

<p>If, during construction, you'll provide a function as an initializing value, it will be assigned as-is (not will be called).</p>

<h1 id="namespaces">NAMESPACES</h1>

<p>In Joose, each class also act a namespace with the same name. </p>

<p>The name of the class can consist from one or several <em>namespace segments</em>. The separator symbol is a dot: <code>.</code> 
After declaration, Joose translates the class's name to constructor and place it into appropriate namespace. For example:</p>

<pre><code>    Class("MyApp.Point", {
        has: {
            x: {is: "ro"},
            y: {is: "rw"},
        }
    })

    Class("MyApp.Point.ThreeD", {
        isa: Point,

        has: {
            z: {}
        }
    })

    Class("MyApp", {
        has: {
            name: null
        }
    })

    var point = new MyApp.Point()
    var point3d = new MyApp.Point.ThreeD()
    var myapp = new MyApp()
</code></pre>

<p>Note, how <code>MyApp</code> class was created already after its namespace segment was declared.</p>

<h1 id="bodybuilder"><code>body</code> BUILDER</h1>

<p>Each class also support special builder <code>body</code>, which should be a function. </p>

<pre><code>    Class("MyApp.Point.ThreeD", {
        isa: Point,

        has: {
            z: {}
        },

        body : function (myAppPoint3D) {
            console.log(myAppPoint3D == MyApp.Point.ThreeD) //prints 'true'

            console.log(this == MyApp.Point.ThreeD) //prints 'true'

            ....

            var private = new MyApp.Point.ThreeD({ x: 1, y : 2, z: 3})

            ....

            MyApp.Point.ThreeD.meta.extend({
                methods : {
                }
            })
        }
    })
</code></pre>

<p>This function will be called right after class construction, with the class's constructor as 1st argument and in the same scope.</p>

<p>The class will be already fully constructed at the time of <code>body</code> execution, you can create its instances or even <em>extend</em> it with some additional
methods (see <a href="Mutability.html">Joose.Manual.Mutability</a> for details)</p>
