<p>Joose.Manual.Construction - Object construction with Joose</p>

<h1 id="wherestheconstructor">WHERE'S THE CONSTRUCTOR?</h1>

<p>Do not re-define a constructor method for your classes! You were warned. </p>

<p>When you build a class using Joose it will be managed by the instance of Joose.Meta.Class. This instance (a <em>metaclass instance</em>) provides a constructor for you. This constructor will perform attributes initialization and then will call a 'initialize' method with the same arguments.
So, instead of constructor, define an <strong>initialize</strong> method for your class.</p>

<p>However, if you are still sure you need a custom constructor you may provide it using a <em>constructor</em> builder:</p>

<pre><code>Class('User', {

    constructor : function (i, really, know, what, iam, doing) {
    }

    ....
})
</code></pre>

<h1 id="objectconstructionandattributes">OBJECT CONSTRUCTION AND ATTRIBUTES</h1>

<p>The Joose-provided constructor accepts an object with properties, matching your attributes. This is just another way in which Joose keeps you from worrying how classes are implemented. Simply define a class and you're ready to start creating objects!</p>

<pre><code>Class('User', {
    isa : Person,

    has : {
        password : { init : '12345' },
        lastLogin : { init : function () { return new Date() } }
    }
})

var user = new User({
    password : 'abcdef',
    lastLogin : 'Yesterday'
})
</code></pre>

<p>If, during construction, you'll provide a function as a property value, it will be used as-is (not will be called).</p>
