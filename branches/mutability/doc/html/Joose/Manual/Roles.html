<p>Joose.Manual.Roles - Roles, an alternative to deep hierarchies and base classes</p>

<h1 id="whatisarole">WHAT IS A ROLE?</h1>

<p>A role is something that classes do. Usually, a role encapsulates some piece of behavior or state that can be shared between classes. It is important to understand that roles are not classes. 
You cannot inherit from a role, and a role cannot be instantiated. We sometimes say that roles are <em>consumed</em>, either by classes or other roles.</p>

<p>Instead, a role is <em>composed</em> into a class. In practical terms, this means that all of the methods and attributes defined in a role are added directly to (we sometimes say <em>flattened into</em>) the class that consumes the role. 
These attributes and methods then appear as if they were <em>defined in the class itself</em>. A subclass of the consuming class will inherit all of these methods and attributes.</p>

<p>Joose roles are similar to mixins or interfaces in other languages.</p>

<p>Besides defining their own methods and attributes, roles can also require that the consuming class define certain methods of its own. You could have a role that consisted only of a list of required methods, 
in which case the role would be very much like a Java interface.</p>

<p>Note that attribute accessors also count as methods for the purposes of satisfying the requirements of a role.</p>

<h1 id="asimplerole">A SIMPLE ROLE</h1>

<p>Creating a role looks a lot like creating a Joose class:</p>

<pre><code>    Role('Winged', {
        has : {
            leftWing : { is : 'rw' },
            rightWing : { is : 'rw' }
        },

        methods : {

            flight : function () {
                leftWing.flutter()
                rightWing.flutter()
            },

            land : function () {
                leftWing.hold()
                rightWing.hold()
            }
        }
    })
</code></pre>

<p>Except for our use of Role, this looks just like a class definition with Joose. However, this is not a class, and it cannot be instantiated.</p>

<p>Instead, its attributes and methods will be composed into classes which use the role:</p>

<pre><code>    Class('Eagle', {
        isa : Animal,

        does : Winged
    })
</code></pre>

<p>The 'does' builder composes roles into a class. Once that is done, the Eagle class has an 'leftWing/rightWing' attributes and a number of 'fly*' methods. </p>

<pre><code>    var eagle = new Eagle()

    eagle.flight()
    eagle.land()
</code></pre>

<p>We could use this same role into another class:</p>

<pre><code>    Class('Gryphon', {
        isa : Lion,

        does : Winged
    })

    var gryphon = new Gryphon()

    gryphon.flight()
    gryphon.land()
</code></pre>

<h1 id="requiredmethods.usingmethodmodifiers">REQUIRED METHODS. USING METHOD MODIFIERS</h1>

<p>As mentioned previously, a role can require that consuming classes provide one or more methods. Using our 'Winged' example, make it require that consuming classes implement their own 'turnLeft' and 'turnRight' methods:</p>

<pre><code>    Role('Winged', {
        require : [ 'turnLeft', 'turnRight' ],

        has : {
            isFlying : false,

            leftWing : { is : 'rw' },
            rightWing : { is : 'rw' }
        },

        methods : {

            flight : function () {
                leftWing.flutter()
                rightWing.flutter()

                this.isFlying = true
            },

            land : function () {
                leftWing.hold()
                rightWing.hold()

                this.isFlying = false
            },

            flyLeft : function () {
                leftWing.hold()
                rightWing.flutter()
            },

            flyRight : function () {
                leftWing.flutter()
                rightWing.hold()
            },
        },

        override : {
            turnLeft : function () {
                if (this.isFlying) 
                    this.flyLeft()
                else
                    this.SUPER()
            },

            turnRight : function () {
                if (this.isFlying)
                    this.flyRight()
                else
                    this.SUPER()
            }
        }
    })
</code></pre>

<p>If we try to consume this role in a class that does not have a 'turnRight' or 'turnLeft' method, we will get an exception.</p>

<p>You can see that we added a method modifier on 'turnLeft/turnRight'. We want classes that consume this role to implement their own "ground" logic for turning, but we make sure that this logic will be overriden during flight.</p>

<p>Method modifiers and roles are a very powerful combination. Often, a role will combine method modifiers and required methods. We already saw one example with our Winged role.</p>

<p>Method modifiers increase the complexity of roles, because they make the role application order relevant. 
If a class uses multiple roles, each of which modify the same method, those modifiers will be applied in the same order as the roles are used.</p>

<h2 id="rolesversusabstractbaseclasses">Roles Versus Abstract Base Classes</h2>

<p>If you are familiar with the concept of abstract base classes in other languages, you may be tempted to use roles in the same way.</p>

<p>You can define an "interface-only" role, one that contains just a list of required methods.</p>

<p>However, any class which consumes this role must implement all of the required methods, either directly or through inheritance from a parent. 
You cannot delay the method requirement check so that they can be implemented by future subclasses.</p>

<p>Because the role defines the required methods directly, adding a base class to the mix would not achieve anything. 
We recommend that you simply consume the interface role in each class which implements that interface.</p>

<h1 id="methodconflicts">METHOD CONFLICTS</h1>

<p>If a class composes multiple roles, and those roles have methods of the same name, we will have a <em>methods conflict</em>. One of the solutions for such case, is that the composing class is required to provide its own method of the same name. 
For example:</p>

<pre><code>    Role('Walk', {
        have : {
            walking : false
        },

        methods : {
            walk : function (where) { this.walking = true },
            stop : function () { this.walking = false }
        }
    }) 

    Role('Eat', {
        have : {
            eating : false
        },

        methods : {
            eat : function (food) { this.eating = true },
            stop : function () { this.eating = false }
        }
    })
</code></pre>

<p>If we compose both Walk and Eat in a class, we must provide our own 'stop' method:</p>

<pre><code>    Class('Creature', {
        does : [ Walk, Eat ],

        methods : {
            stop : function () {
                this.walking = false
                this.eating = false
            }
        }
    })
</code></pre>

<h1 id="methodexclusionandaliasing">METHOD EXCLUSION AND ALIASING</h1>

<p>If we want our Creature class to be able to call the methods from both its roles, we can alias the methods:</p>

<pre><code>    Class('Creature', {
        does : [{
            role : Walk,
            alias : {
                stop : 'stopWalk'
            }
        }, {
            role : Eat,
            alias : {
                stop : 'stopEat'
            }
        }]
    })
</code></pre>

<p>However, aliasing a method simply makes a copy of the method with the new name. We also need to exclude the original name:</p>

<pre><code>    Class('Creature', {
        does : [{
            role : Walk,
            alias : {
                stop : 'stopWalk'
            },
            exclude : [ 'stop' ]
        }, {
            role : Eat,
            alias : {
                stop : 'stopEat'
            },
            exclude : [ 'stop' ]
        }]
    })
</code></pre>

<p>The 'exclude' parameter prevents the 'stop' method from being composed into the Creature class, so we don't have a conflict. This means that Creature does not need to implement its own 'stop' method.</p>

<p>This is useful, but it's worth noting that this breaks the contract implicit in consuming a role. Our Creature class does both the Walk and Eat, but does not provide a 'stop' method. 
If some API expects an object that does one of those roles, it probably expects it to implement that method.</p>

<p>In some use cases we might alias and exclude methods from roles, but then provide a method of the same name in the class itself.</p>
