Joose.Manual.Construction - Object construction with Joose

WHERE'S THE CONSTRUCTOR?
========================

Do not re-define a constructor method for your classes! You were warned. 

When you build a class using Joose it will be managed by the instance of Joose.Meta.Class. This instance (a *metaclass instance*) provides a constructor for you. This constructor will perform attributes initialization and then will call a 'initialize' method with the same arguments.
So, instead of constructor, define an **initialize** method for your class.

However, if you are still sure you need a custom constructor you may provide it using a *constructor* builder:

    Class('User', {

        constructor : function (i, really, know, what, iam, doing) {
        }

        ....
    })



OBJECT CONSTRUCTION AND ATTRIBUTES
==================================

The Joose-provided constructor accepts an object with properties, matching your attributes. This is just another way in which Joose keeps you from worrying how classes are implemented. Simply define a class and you're ready to start creating objects!

    Class('User', {
        isa : Person,

        has : {
            password : { init : '12345' },
            lastLogin : { init : function () { return new Date() } }
        }
    })

    var user = new User({
        password : 'abcdef',
        lastLogin : 'Yesterday'
    })

If, during construction, you'll provide a function as a property value, it will be used as-is (not will be called).
