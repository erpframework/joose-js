#summary Installation instructions for Joose

= Download =

Download the latest release of Joose from the [http://code.google.com/p/joose-js/downloads/list downloads page]. We currently only upload stable releases, so you can just grap the latest and greatest.

= Include = 

Copy the file joose.js or joose.mini.js to your application's JavaScript directory
and include it in your html pages with something like:
{{{
<script type="text/javascript" src="/path/to/joose.js"></script>
}}}
The file _joose.mini.js_ is the same as the file _joose.js_. The only difference is
removed white space and comments which reduces the file size and improves page
loading time. We recommend using joose.js in development and joose.mini.js in
production systems.
There also extra files whithe the .gz extention. These are packed for even smaller file sizes. If your web-server supports using these compressed files, it will improve load time even more.

For some functionality you will also need the JavaScript JSON library
which you can obtain [http://www.json.org/js.html JSON.org]
