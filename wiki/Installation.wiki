#summary Installation instructions for Joose

Download the latest release of Joose from the [http://code.google.com/p/joose-js/downloads/list downloads page]

Copy the file joose.js or joose.mini.js to your application's JavaScript directory
and include it in your html pages with
{{{
<script type="text/javascript" src="/path/to/joose.js"></script>
}}}
The file _joose.mini.js_ is the same as the file _joose.js_. The only difference is
removed white space and comments which reduces the file size and improves page
loading time. We recommend using joose.js in development and joose.mini.js in
production systems.

For some functionality you will also need the JavaScript JSON library
which you can obtain [http://www.json.org/js.html JSON.org]
