#summary This page describes how Joose behaves in conjunction with other frameworks

= Introduction =

The Joose object system makes writing object-oriented code in JavaScript more productive. It is not a general purpose JavaScript framework. 
Joose
 * has no methods to traverse or manipulate the DOM
 * does not enforce a particular component framework
 * could run in any JavaScript environment (not just the browser, but also on the server side or within Flash (as ActionScript))

= Using Joose with another JavaScript framework =

Joose should work very Well with other JavaScript frameworks. It does however reserve some global function that should not be used by the other framework. These are:
 * Joose :)
 * Class
 * Module
 * Role
 * Prototype
 * joosify

= Tests =

Joose has been thoroughly tested in conjuction with
 * [http://jquery.com/ jQuery]

If you are using Joose with another framework like Dojo, Prototype, Ext or Mootools, please tell us.
