#summary This page describes how Joose behaves in conjunction with other frameworks

= Introduction =

The Joose object system makes writing object-oriented code in JavaScript more productive. It is not a general purpose JavaScript framework. 
Joose
 * has no methods to traverse or manipulate the DOM
 * does not enforce a particular component framework
 * could run in any JavaScript environment (not just the browser, but also on the server side or within Flash (as ActionScript))

Thus we recommend to use Joose together with a JavaSscript library that facilitates DOM access.
